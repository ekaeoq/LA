Calculating the height of a pyramid using the normal vector involves understanding how vectors and geometric properties relate to each other. Here's a detailed explanation of the concept:

### Basics of Normal Vectors and Height Calculation

1. **Normal Vector**: A normal vector to a plane is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane. If we have a plane with a known equation or defined by three points, we can calculate the normal vector.

2. **Height of the Pyramid**: The height of a pyramid is the perpendicular distance from the apex (the top point of the pyramid) to the base (a plane).

### Vector Dot Product and Projection

To find the height of the pyramid, we need to project a vector from the apex to a point in the base onto the normal vector of the base. This projection will give us the perpendicular (or normal) distance, which is the height of the pyramid.

### Steps to Calculate the Height

1. **Define the Points**:
   - Let's denote the apex of the pyramid as \( P \).
   - The base of the pyramid is defined by points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

2. **Find the Normal Vector of the Base**:
   - Calculate vectors in the base plane, e.g., \( \vec{AB} \) and \( \vec{AC} \).
   - Compute the normal vector \( \vec{n} \) to the base using the cross product: \( \vec{n} = \vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} \).

3. **Vector from Apex to a Point in the Base**:
   - Choose any point in the base, say \( A \).
   - Compute the vector \( \vec{PA} \) from the apex \( P \) to the point \( A \): \( \vec{PA} = \vec{A} - \vec{P} \).

4. **Project the Vector onto the Normal Vector**:
   - Calculate the projection of \( \vec{PA} \) onto the normal vector \( \vec{n} \).
   - The projection formula is: 
     \[
     \text{Proj}_{\vec{n}} \vec{PA} = \frac{\vec{PA} \cdot \vec{n}}{\|\vec{n}\|^2} \vec{n}
     \]
   - The height \( h \) is the magnitude of this projection:
     \[
     h = \left\| \frac{\vec{PA} \cdot \vec{n}}{\|\vec{n}\|} \right\|
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     h = \frac{|\vec{PA} \cdot \vec{n}|}{\|\vec{n}\|}
     \]
     where \( \vec{PA} \cdot \vec{n} \) is the dot product of \( \vec{PA} \) and \( \vec{n} \), and \( \|\vec{n}\| \) is the magnitude of the normal vector.

### Interpretation

- **Upright Normal Vector**: The normal vector is perpendicular to the plane, not necessarily upright. Its direction depends on the orientation of the plane.
- **Height Calculation**: The calculation essentially measures how far the apex is from the base plane along the direction perpendicular to the base (as given by the normal vector).

### Example Calculation

Let's illustrate this with an example.

1. **Define the Points**: 
   - \( P = (p_x, p_y, p_z) \)
   - \( A = (a_x, a_y, a_z) \)
   - \( B = (b_x, b_y, b_z) \)
   - \( C = (c_x, c_y, c_z) \)

2. **Compute Vectors in the Base**:
   \[
   \vec{AB} = (b_x - a_x, b_y - a_y, b_z - a_z)
   \]
   \[
   \vec{AC} = (c_x - a_x, c_y - a_y, c_z - a_z)
   \]

3. **Find the Normal Vector**:
   \[
   \vec{n} = \vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}
   \]
   \[
   \vec{n} = \begin{vmatrix}
   \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
   b_x - a_x & b_y - a_y & b_z - a_z \\
   c_x - a_x & c_y - a_y & c_z - a_z
   \end{vmatrix}
   \]

4. **Vector from Apex to a Point in the Base**:
   \[
   \vec{PA} = (a_x - p_x, a_y - p_y, a_z - p_z)
   \]

5. **Project \( \vec{PA} \) onto \( \vec{n} \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{|\vec{PA} \cdot \vec{n}|}{\|\vec{n}\|}
   \]
   where:
   \[
   \vec{PA} \cdot \vec{n} = (a_x - p_x)n_x + (a_y - p_y)n_y + (a_z - p_z)n_z
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \|\vec{n}\| = \sqrt{n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2}
   \]

By following these steps, you can find the height of the pyramid using the normal vector to the base plane.

Not exactly! Let me refine that explanation. You’re close, but the key idea isn’t that the columns "need to be the same" — it’s about whether they are **linearly independent** or not. Here’s a clearer breakdown:

---

### 1. Why Do We Only Consider 3 Columns?
- The matrix \( A \) originally has **4 columns**, but the **rank** of \( A \) is **3**. This means:
  - Only **3 columns are linearly independent**.
  - The **4th column is dependent** on the other 3, meaning it can be expressed as a linear combination of them.
  
#### Example of Linear Dependence
Let’s say we have the following 4 columns of \( A \):
\[
v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
v_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 8 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
v_4 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Here:
- \( v_4 = 2 \cdot v_1 \), so \( v_4 \) is linearly dependent on \( v_1 \).
- The rank of this matrix is 3 because \( v_1, v_2, v_3 \) are independent, but \( v_4 \) doesn’t add a new "dimension."

---

### 2. What Does Linear Independence Mean?
**Linear independence** means no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. For example:
- If \( v_4 = c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2 + c_3 \cdot v_3 \) for some constants \( c_1, c_2, c_3 \), then \( v_4 \) is **dependent**.
- If this happens, \( v_4 \) doesn’t contribute any new information or "direction" to the span of the vectors.

So, when \( A \) has rank 3, we only consider the **3 independent columns** because the 4th one doesn’t add anything new to the span.

---

### 3. Why Does the Matrix Need to Be Independent?
To determine properties like rank, span, or invertibility, we analyze whether the **columns of the matrix** (or rows) are linearly independent:
- If all 4 columns are independent, \( \text{rank}(A) = 4 \), and \( A \) spans \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).
- If only 3 columns are independent, \( \text{rank}(A) = 3 \), and \( A \) spans a 3-dimensional subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).

---

### 4. Why Does the Matrix Fail When Rank = 3?
If \( A \) has rank = 3, it means:
- \( A \) does not span the full \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so it cannot be a basis for \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).
- \( A \) is **not invertible** because an invertible matrix requires rank = number of columns = 4.

---

### 5. Key Idea
You don’t reduce to 3 columns because they "need to be the same." Instead:
- You reduce to 3 columns because only 3 are **independent**.
- The 4th column is **redundant**, as it is dependent on the other 3.

Would you like a worked-out numerical example to make this even clearer?
Great question! The decision of which column to remove isn’t always obvious at first glance, but there’s a systematic way to decide based on **linear dependence**. Let’s break it down:

---

### 1. When Two Columns Are Identical
If two columns in the matrix are the same, you can **definitely remove one of them** because:
- Identical columns are **linearly dependent** (one is just a duplicate of the other).
- Keeping both wouldn’t add any new "direction" to the span of the columns.

---

### 2. When No Columns Are Identical
If none of the columns are identical, you must determine which one is a **linear combination** of the others. This is where **Gaussian elimination** (row reduction) helps:
- During elimination, you transform the matrix to its row-echelon form.
- The **pivot columns** (the ones with leading 1s) correspond to the **independent columns**.
- Any column that isn’t a pivot column is a linear combination of the pivot columns and can be removed.

---

### 3. Systematic Way to Choose Columns
#### Example Matrix
Suppose we have the matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 3 & 4 & 5
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Let’s figure out which columns are linearly independent.

#### Step 1: Perform Row Reduction
Using Gaussian elimination:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 3 & 4 & 5
\end{bmatrix}
\to
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\to
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

#### Step 2: Identify Pivot Columns
The pivot columns are **column 1** and **column 2**, as they contain the leading 1s in the row-reduced form.

#### Step 3: Remove Dependent Columns
Columns 3 and 4 are dependent:
- Column 3 = \( 1 \cdot \text{Column 1} + 1 \cdot \text{Column 2} \).
- Column 4 = \( 2 \cdot \text{Column 1} + 1 \cdot \text{Column 2} \).

Thus, we keep **columns 1 and 2** and remove the others.

---

### 4. Key Rules to Follow
1. **Identical Columns**: Immediately remove duplicates.
2. **Gaussian Elimination**: Use it to find pivot columns (these are the independent ones).
3. **Dependent Columns**: If a column can be expressed as a combination of the others, remove it.

---

### 5. Why Pivot Columns?
The pivot columns guarantee the set is **linearly independent**, ensuring the chosen columns span the same space as the original matrix.
